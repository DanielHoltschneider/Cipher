This program contains a Encryption, decryption, and decipher algorithm. The encryption given 2 numbers a,b the file will be encrypted. given the encryption file, and the same a, and b, then the file will be decrypted into an output file. The decipher method, given a dictionary file and an encrypted file, the program will go through all possible a and b combonations until it finds an a,b value that provides the most words, then decrypts the file with that a and b.
